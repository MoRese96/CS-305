# CS-305

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that builds personal financial plans, and they asked me to review their web application for security issues to better protect sensitive customer data. I found and explained vulnerabilities, applied fixes, and wrote code securely to prevent risks like data theft and loss of trust. A challenge was deciding which warnings from the testing tools were most important, but this helped me learn to focus on the biggest risks first. To improve security, I used encryption, updated libraries, and tested the code after changes to make sure it stayed functional without adding new problems. Tools like secure coding practices, testing frameworks, and Maven dependency-check were very useful and will help in future projects. This assignment is a strong example of my ability to create software that is both secure and reliable, and it is something I could show employers to demonstrate my skills.
